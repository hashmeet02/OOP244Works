In workshop 1 part 1, I learned the significance and 
layout of putting safeguards (ifndef-endif) in header 
file I also learnt about the concept of using namespaces 
as I created a namespace called sdds and used namespaces 
sdds and std. This helped me convert a long piece of code 
into different modules that seamlessly work together to 
create an application.

In workshop 2 part 2, at first I was having a hard time 
to think of a logic that differentiates between question 
and answers while loading quiz files into the structs 
After lots of effort I took help from my friend Sebastian 
Rubina  Schanez (fellow classmate) in creating the LoadQuiz 
and loadQues. Based on this these functions I progressed 
ahead by making other valid structs and functions that 
accomplished the targets of this part -2 of workshop. 
One tricky part I had to go through was the function 
IsQuizValid().  When I began framing the logic for this 
code, it had several loops and if statements that made the 
function complicated. Also previously I was storing the 
type of question as a string “mc” or “ma” in the structs 
which seemed to break the code at line strcmp 
(quiztemp.ques[i].type, “mc”). So to tackle these 
situations I framed a simpler logic to check if every 
question and quiz is valid and also I modified my struc 
to hold type as ‘C’ (char) instead of a character array. 
This eliminated the need of using strcmp function and the 
code line was changed to quiztemp.ques[i].type==“mc”. I 
learned how to design structs and functions in this workshop.
