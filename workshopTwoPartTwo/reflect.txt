I have done all the coding but received help from professor 
Fardad Soleimanloo in struct definition by myself and only 
copied the code that my professor provided to complete my 
workshops and assignments.

In this week's reflection I learned the concept of
function overloading which focussed on how functions
with same name but different parameter types are essentially
two different function in C++. I used this concept in Part 1
of this week's workshop to create 3 overloads of read function 
that read the content from the file, but one read char string, 
one read integer number and one raed char. I also created two
overload functions of load().
Another concept I learned was allocating dynamic memory for 
structure arrays and character strings. I got to use this 
feature in both part 1 and part 2 of this workshop to hold the
records imported from a file. In part 2 I did have to difficulty 
in importing data from the text file due to file corruption
and struct design but with the help of professor Fardad 
Soleimanloo I was able to successfully finish this workshop.
