I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The main learning concept of this workshop was creating a derived 
class which has a resource (dynamically allocated attributes). In 
this workshop the base class Name which stored a dynamically 
allocated first name and FullName was the class derived from Name 
that contained the dynamically allocated last name. Name class 
had a few virtual and non-virtual methods which were overridden 
in the FullName class. I also learned how to correctly implement 
the rule of three, which is the creation of a copy constructor, 
copy assignment operator and a destructor, for a derived class 
with a resource. This was a trickier part to code but I used my 
prior codes and the new weekly notes to correctly program the rule 
of three. I also used what I learned throughout the semester to 
read the user inputs by using get, getline, ignore and more and 
also correctly store that data into dynamically allocated spaces. 
For this purpose I used a separate Utility module that can handle 
the most character string operations like calculating length, 
copying 1 string to another and also dynamically copying 1 string 
to another.
