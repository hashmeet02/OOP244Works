I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that 
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this week’s workshop, I learned to work with an object called 
class. This workshop was the first biggest step into object 
orientation as I learned how I can instantiate a defined class, how 
I can privatize members of a class and also declare member functions 
that help me access the private members. Another small concept that 
I learned was declaring variables and setting them straight to a 
safe state by using {}. Where part 1 of this week’s workshop 
focussed on the usage of a basic class and the precision function of 
cout, part 2 took this concept to the next level as it required me 
to create a class object nested inside another class object. Also, 
it required me to use other functions of cout family like width, 
fill and set to set the spacing, mention what kind of spacing, 
and what alignment of text I want in the output respectively. I also 
created two dynamically allocated arrays to store the title of the 
chart and the array of bars in the barChart class. This workshop was 
well-paced, with simpler objectives in part 1 and tougher in part 2 
making it fun to learn and understand.
