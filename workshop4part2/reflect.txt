I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this week’s workshop, the main concept that I worked on was 
creating and using constructors. I learned how I can define new 
Constructors- default and overloaded. In addition to that, I 
created a destructor for my class which gave me full control over 
how my class object would be created and deleted. To assist me 
with creating dynamic character string arrays, every time I want to 
use some strings as class Members, I created a separate Utility module 
which eliminated the need to write a lengthy series of code lines 
repeatedly. I further learned how to decide what member variables 
and methods should be private or public and what functions need to 
be helper functions. I expanded my knowledge on the use of cout 
functions that help me enhance the format of the content of the 
application displayed. In part 2 sorting the data in descending 
order according to the battery was the toughest part of this week’s 
workshop due to memory leak problems but I was able to correct 
those with the help of a different logic that eliminated the 
use of additional dynamic memory.
