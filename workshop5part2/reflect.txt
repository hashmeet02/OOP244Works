I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This weekâ€™s workshop focused on overloading operators to make 
classes easier to use. The first part of the workshop was more 
intensive in terms of overloading member operators which included 
binary operators like +=, -+, <<, unary operators like postfix ++ 
and prefix ++ and -- along with several casting operators which 
allowed me to cast my class object to obtain various kinds of 
results. In addition to this, I learned the proper functionality of 
using ostream objects to create display functions that help me not 
only display but bring cascading effects to the objects. I learned 
how to properly create the operator prototypes, where to return 
references, where the function needs to be const and more. In the 
second part of the workshop, I learned how to define and create 
helper operators. The trickiest part in my opinion was handling the 
dynamic array of powers as I needed to come up with a way that 
extended this array every time, I wanted to add power to the Hero 
object. After spending some time thinking about a logic, I was 
able to come up with a way and I successfully completed the workshop 
with no memory leaks.
