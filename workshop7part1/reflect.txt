Reflection Workshop 7 Part 2
Name:			Hashmeet Singh Saini
Seneca ID : hsaini28

Date : July 13, 2022
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*******************************************************************
In this workshop, I learned and strengthened the concepts of derived 
and base class which follows the form of Inheritance. I also learned 
how to use the concept of shadow to override base class functions 
with derived class functions to use the same-named functions with 
different purposes for the base and different classes. This also 
involved learning how to call a shadowed member function from the 
base class using scope resolution. I also strengthened my concept 
around extraction and insertion operator overloads used for input and 
output and also as operators which add data to a class. In this 
workshop memberParliament was a base class, through which I inherited 
a derived class named Minister. I learned the format to create a 
derived class and the use of access keywords- private, public and 
protected. For this workshop, the toughest part was the creation of 
the derived class itself but I was able to do it easily once I went 
through the weekly notes.
