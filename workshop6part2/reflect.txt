I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*******************************************************************
In this weekâ€™s workshop, I learned a variety of things making a C++ 
class more intuitive to use. This involved the creation of a copy 
constructor and a copy assignment operator which enable the formation 
of a new constructor using an existing constructor. Additionally, I 
learned to use the different functions of the fstream object which 
were required to be used in part 1 of workshop as I created a code 
that counts the number of records in the file on the basis of newline 
characters and also loads the different records (doubles in this 
situation) in a dynamically allocated class. Moreover, I learned to 
create an input operator function with a read function enabling me 
to obtain data from the user. I also learned how I could resize my 
dynamically allocated array whenever I wanted to add a new record to 
the array. This was not the most challenging workshop, but I had fun 
doing it as it helped boost my confidence.
