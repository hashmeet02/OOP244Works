Reflection Workshop 8 Part 2

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*******************************************************************
This workshop dived deeper into the concept of abstract classes and 
pure virtual function. I learned how to create an interface header 
file that involves. An abstract class where all the member 
functions are virtual(here, iAccount). Then I proceeded to learn 
how to derive a base class from this interface called Account and 
use that further to create two derived classes. This workshop 
helped me properly visualize the concept of inheritance in object 
orientation. It further helped me learn how the pure virtual 
functions are implemented in the derived class, and what are the 
differences between an abstract and concrete class. The toughest part 
of this workshop was getting accustomed to the new technical terms 
mentioned above, and I was able to do this by going through the 
weekly notes. The tricky part of visualizing the hierarchy was fulfilled 
by the illustration provided in the workshop instructions which greatly 
helped in simplifying the design of the code.
