###### This is all that I have learnt during my time studying Introduction to Object Oriented Programming using C++. It includes my weekly workshop challanges and the milestones for the Final Project. There is no limit to the knowledge I gained through this course.

## A sincere request: 
This content has been displayed here only to showcase my experience in C++'s Object Oriented programming. Any student who comes across these documents is warned NOT TO USE them as their homework as it is plagiarism and a clear violation of Seneca's Academic Integrity!
